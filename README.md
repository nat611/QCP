Helll and welcome to our Quantum Computing Project! 

There are three files uploaded to the Github: main, QC_Grovers, and Quantum Error Correction. 

main and QC_Grovers are the two Grover's Algorithm files, with main referred to as the matrix-based Grovers and QC_Grovers referred to as the circuit-based Grovers in the report. 

The Quantum Error Correction file containes the code for the quantum error correction algorithm.
